## Presentation?

You decide what you want to present in the _Presentation_ block. Likely, it is a good idea to focus on the highlights of your projects/reports with regards to the gives perspectives (system, process, lessons learned). 

If you realize that you described something wrongly in your reports or that you were missing to provide some information there, you might want to present "fixes" for that too.

Of course we read your reports prior to the exams. That is, you can assume for your presentations that we are reasonably versed in your project.

Make sure that every group member takes part in the presentation.


## Questions & Discussion?

Our questions and discussions will be based on your reports and thereby on your projects. For example, we will ask something like in the following:

There will not be any predefined set of questions. Instead the questions will be based on your submitted work and thereby on your projects. For example, we will ask something like in the following: 

  - "In your report you describe that you deploy manually to production once per month. Please explain to which degree and why that is a good decision in a DevOps project."
  - "You describe that you decided to implement your project in QBasic on DOS 5 as operating system. Please provide a rationale for that decision. Can you explain the impact of that decision on maintainability of your system?"
  - "You describe that your group was organized around a single _'wizard'_ that implemented everything and the other team members took care of organizational issues around implementation. Why did you choose such an organization? How could you organize work so that further maintenance and refactoring tasks are doable once the _'wizard'_ gets sick? What would a DevOps advocate say about your team organization?"
  - "You explain that you deploy your software in Docker containers. What is the reason for that?

All of your team members will be in the exam room at once and we will make sure to distribute questions equally. Likely, we will jump from person to person per question.
