## Presentation?

You decide what you want to present in the _Presentation_ block. Likely, it is a good idea to focus on the highlights of your projects/reports with regards to the gives perspectives (system, process, lessons learned). 

If you realize that you described something wrongly in your reports or that you were missing to provide some information there, you might want to present "fixes" for that too.

Of course we read your reports prior to the exams. That is, you can assume for your presentations that we are reasonably versed in your project.

Make sure that every group member takes part in the presentation.


## Questions & Discussion?

Our questions and discussions will be based on your reports and thereby on your projects. For example, we will ask something like in the following:

There will not be any predefined set of questions. Instead the questions will be based on your submitted work and thereby on your projects. For example, we will ask something like in the following: 

  - "In your report you describe that you deploy manually to production once per month. Please explain to which degree and why that is a good decision in a DevOps project."
  - "You describe that you decided to implement your project in QBasic on DOS 5 as operating system. Please provide a rationale for that decision. Can you explain the impact of that decision on maintainability of your system?"
  - "You describe that your group was organized around a single _'wizard'_ that implemented everything and the other team members took care of organizational issues around implementation. Why did you choose such an organization? How could you organize work so that further maintenance and refactoring tasks are doable once the _'wizard'_ gets sick? What would a DevOps advocate say about your team organization?"
  - "You explain that you deploy your software in Docker containers. What is the reason for that?

All of your team members will be in the exam room at once and we will make sure to distribute questions equally. Likely, we will jump from person to person per question.

# Information on the Online Exam

## Rules 

  * The usual exam rules are valid - see [ITU Student](https://itustudent.itu.dk/)
  * Follow the [IT security guidelines](https://itustudent.itu.dk/news/information-about-coronavirus/zoom-and-cyber-security)
  * Bring your **Student Card**. If asked by the examiner, you must show your Student Card to the examiners. 
  * Place yourself somewhere you feel comfortable sharing, as you must have your **camera on** during the entire examination in order to make the online exam as close as possible to ordinary face-to-face exams. **Sharing your screen** is the only exception, as Zoom does not share video and screen at the same time. 
  * Try making sure you don't get disturbed during the exam. ITU trusts that students adhere to the exam rules and that **you do not receive any help** during the exam. If asked by the examiners, students must show the room you are located in. ITU thus adheres to the national guidelines stating that students must be able to prove that they are alone in participating in the examination and that they do not receive any help during the exam. Once you have shown the room, you can display a background picture to maintain privacy. ([See how to add a virtual background](https://app.vidgrid.com/view/gr7foPDWpx2E))

  * Your group's exam room opens already a week prior to the actual exam. That is, they all open on June 2nd
