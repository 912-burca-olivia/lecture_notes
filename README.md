## Requirements

All examples in class target [Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](http://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/). Since all sessions contain hands-on exercises, we recommend that you have this version of Ubuntu installed on your laptop computer. (In case you decide to run another operating system, we cannot provide too much support for these during class.) The recommended setup is to have Ubuntu installed natively on your machine. 


Remember to backup your data before starting the installation process and in particular resizing your partitions! Also double check values before repartitioning!


The following links are exemplary guides, you might find others that are even more suitable to your personal setup.

##### Installing Ubuntu as Virtual Machine 

In case non of the above options of installing Ubuntu are an option for you, you might want to install Ubuntu in a Virtual Machine (VM). Be aware however, that not all contents of the lecture (virtualization part in session 3) can be
