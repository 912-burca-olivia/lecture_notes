Since there is so much exercise and project work until session four, an **optional and interesting reading** introducing build systems are the first seven pages of the paper [_"Build Systems Ã  la Carte_"](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2018/03/build-systems.pdf).

Read that only if you have spare brain cycles. Otherwise focus on your project work.
