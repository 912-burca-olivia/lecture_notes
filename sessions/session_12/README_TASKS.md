## Infrastructure as Code

The final part of your project is automating also the creation of infrastructure. 
You can choose how you want to do it:
- Using Terraform
- Using Vagrant (can do most of the things that are required)
- Bash scripts that use the 
	- REST API of the VM provider
	- command line tool of the provider (e.g. [doctl](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/doctl/) for DigitalOcean)
