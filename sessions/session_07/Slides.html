# Software Quality?

---

Now, that we are in the second half of the course and now, that you spent a lot of time evolving and maintaining your *ITU-MiniTwit* systems, some questions might arise:

  * Are your *ITU-MiniTwit* systems any good?
  * How good/bad are your *ITU-MiniTwit* systems?
  * Is there anything one can do to improve quality of your *ITU-MiniTwit* systems?

---

## What is Software Quality?

Generally, _quality_ is defined as:


  > "[...] the totality of characteristics of an entity that bear on its ability to satisfy stated and implied needs."
  >
  > [ISO 8402:1994, Quality management and quality assurance – Vocabulary](https://www.iso.org/standard/20115.html)

--


For the term _software quality_ industrial standards are quite consistent.

  > **(1)** capability of a software product to satisfy stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions
  >
  > [_Systems and software engineering — Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — Guide to
SQuaRE_, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, CH, Standard, May 2015](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:64764:en)
  >
  > **(2)** degree to which a software product satisfies stated and implied needs when used under specified conditions
  >
  > [_Systems and software engineering — Systems and software Quality Requirements and Evaluation (SQuaRE) — System and software quality models_, International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, CH, Standard, May 2015](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:25010:ed-1:v1:en)
  >
  > **(3)** degree to which a software product meets established requirements
  >
  > [_IEEE 730-2014 IEEE Standard for Software Quality Assurance Processes_](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/730-2014.html)

---

## What is Software Quality?

Various stakeholders have particular and varying quality requirements:

  > Good software should deliver the required functionality and performance to the user and should be maintainable, dependable, and usable.
  >
  > [I. Sommerville, _Software Engineering_, 9th ed. USA: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, 2010.](https://www.pearson.com/us/higher-education/product/Sommerville-Software-Engineering-9th-Edition/9780137035151.html)

---

## What is Software Quality?

Various stakeholders have particular and varying quality requirements:

  > ... David Gamin studied how quality is perceived in various domains, including philosophy, economics, marketing, and operations management. He concluded that "quality is a complex and multifaceted concept" that can be described from five different perspectives.
  >
  >   * The **transcendental view** sees quality as something that can be recognized but not defined.
  >
  >   * The **user view** sees quality as fitness for purpose.
  >
  >   * The **manufacturing view** sees quality as conformance to specification.
  >
  >   * The **product view** sees quality as tied to inherent characteristics of the product.
  >
  >   * The **value-based view** sees quality as dependent on the amount a customer is willing to pay for it.
  >
  > [Kitchenham et al. 1996 _Software Quality: The Elusive Target_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel1/52/10198/00476281.pdf)

One perspective that is missing in the above but that Sommerville describes in chapter 24.4 is the perspective of *software process quality*, which assumes that the better the process leading to a software product the better the product itself.

---

## Software Quality Models

Since there are many software quality models. Let's have a look at the earliest Boehm's model from 1976 and more recent ones from the ISO 250x0 series of standards.

---

### Boehm 1976 - Quality Model

<img src="images/boehm.png" width="60%">

[Boehm et al. _"Quantitative evaluation of software quality"_](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=807736&type=pdf)

---

### Boehm 1976 - Quality Model

---

### ISO 250x0 - Quality Models

<img src="images/ISO_25000.png" width="60%">

---

### ISO 25010 - Quality in Use Model

<img src="images/ISO_25010_in_use.png" width="80%">

---

### ISO 25010 - Product Model

<img src="images/ISO_25010_product.png" width="90%">

---

### ISO 25023 - Metrics (QMEs)

<img src="images/ISO_25023.png" width="80%">

---

### How to measure software quality and quality attributes?

As Sommerville states, it is neither easy nor straight forward:

  > Unfortunately, it is difficult to make direct measurements of many of the software
quality attributes shown in Figure 24.2. Quality attributes such as maintainability, understandability, and usability are external attributes that relate to how developers and users experience the software. They are affected by subjective factors, such as user experience and education, and they cannot therefore be measured objectively. To make a judgment about these attributes, you have to measure some internal attributes of the software (such as its size, complexity, etc.) and assume that these are related to the quality characteristics that you are concerned with.

----------------------------

--


Usually:

  > The project or organization must start by making a list of nonfunctional requirements that define the "right code." We call this the quality model.
  >
  > Letouzey et al. 2012 _"Managing Technical Debt with the SQALE Method"_

Then one has to define and specify metrics, associate them to the quality attributes of interest, translate these  metrics into precise programs/measures on given artifacts, and define how measured values are aggregated in the end for assessment.

---

### Problematic about Software Quality: "What is Software?"


Remember that _software_ is way more than code!


  > [...] software is not just the programs themselves but also all associated documentation and configuration data that is required to make these programs operate correctly.
  >
  > Sommerville _"Software Engineering"_ (9th Ed.)

--


Interestingly, it is not properly defined what software actually is.

  > "Software is the collection of all artifacts, which allow (a) suitably educated person(s) with access to specified and suitable hardware to instantiate a running system.
  >
  > Additionally, the collection of such artifacts allow such (a) person(s) to understand and reason about a systems' working and properties and let them understand why the system is as it is and why it behaves the way it does."
  >
  > _Helge's definition of software_


That is, when you want to measure software quality you have to necessarily look at more than just source code.

---

## Maintainability

As you could already see in the first quality model [Boehm et al. _"Quantitative evaluation of software quality"_](https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=807736&type=pdf) _maintainability_ seems to be an important software quality.


<img src="images/boehm.png" width="50%">

---

This is likely due to:

  > M2. Maintenance typically consumes about 40 to 80 percent (60 percent average) of software costs. Therefore, it is probably the most important life cycle phase.
  >
  > ...
  >
  > M3. Enhancement is responsible for roughly 60 percent of software maintenance costs. Error correction is roughly 17 percent. So, software maintenance is largely about adding new capability to old software, not about fixing it.
  >
  > ...
  >
  > M5. Most software development tasks and software maintenance tasks are the same—except for the additional maintenance task of "understanding the existing product." This task is the dominant maintenance activity, consuming roughly 30 percent of maintenance time. So, you could claim that maintenance is more difficult than development.
  >
  > [Glass _"Frequently Forgotten Fundamental Facts about Software Engineering"_](http://www.eng.auburn.edu/~kchang/comp6710/readings/Forgotten_Fundamentals_IEEE_Software_May_2001.pdf)

---

### What comprises Maintenance?

  * fixing bugs
  * keeping its systems operational
  * investigating failures
  * adapting it to new platforms
  * modifying it for new use cases
  * repaying technical debt
  * adding new features
  * etc.

From: Kleppmann _"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"_

---

### Design for Maintainability according to the ISO 25010 Product Model


  * Modularity
  * Reusability
  * Analysability
  * Modifyability
  * Testability

---

### Design for Maintainability (Kleppmann "Designing Data-Intensive Applications")

...minimize pain during maintenance, and thus avoid creating legacy software ourselves.

  * a) **Operability**
    Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
  * b) **Simplicity**
    Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much complexity as possible from the system. (Note this is not the same as simplicity of the user interface.)
  * c) **Evolvability**
    Make it easy for engineers to make changes to the system in the future, adapting it for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibility, modifiability, or plasticity.

# Technical Debt

---

## Technical Debt?

  > "Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite. ... The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt."
  >
  > Cunningham 1992 _"The WyCash Portfolio Management System"_

--


  - As in the saying *one man's meat is another man's poison*, we do not have generally true measures for software quality, i.e., *quite-right*, see e.g., Kitchenham 1996, Boehm 1976.

  - Often quality is domain specific as for example stated in the ISO 25000 standard:
  > "for interactive consumer software, such as word processor, usability and co-existence with other software, such as mailing software, is considered important. For Internet and open systems, security and interoperability are most important."
  >
  > ISO 25000

Technical Debt (TD) is used as metaphor to describe

  > “technical compromises that are expedient in the short term, but that create a technical context that increases complexity and cost in the long term”
  >
  > Avgeriou et al. [_“Managing technical debt in software engineering (dagstuhl seminar 16162)”_](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/opus/volltexte/2016/6693/pdf/dagrep_v006_i004_p110_s16162.pdf)

<!--
  - TD is:

  > "the cost of the effort required to fix problems that remain in the code when an application is released to operation."

## Practices for Software Quality: Testing

### Why shall we test at all?


  > Testing is intended to show that a program does what it is intended to do and to ­discover program defects before it is put into use.
  >
  > Sommerville _Software Engineering_

Software Quality:

---

### Why shall we test at all?

  > GWS is the web server responsible for serving Google Search queries and is as important to Google Search as air traffic control is to an airport. Back in 2005, as the project swelled in size and complexity, productivity had slowed dramatically. Releases were becoming buggier, and it was taking longer and longer to push them out. Team members had little confidence when making changes to the service, and often found out something was wrong only when features stopped working in production. (At one point, more than 80% of production pushes contained user-affecting bugs that had to be rolled back.)

--

  > To address these problems, the tech lead (TL) of GWS decided to institute a policy of engineer-driven, automated testing. As part of this policy, all new code changes were required to include tests, and those tests would be run continuously. Within a year of instituting this policy, the number of emergency pushes dropped by half. This drop occurred despite the fact that the project was seeing a record number of new changes every quarter.
  >
  > T. Winters et al. _Software Engineering at Google_

---

### What are tests?

  > The simplest test is defined by:
  > * A single behavior you are testing, usually a method or API that you are calling
  > * A specific input, some value that you pass to the API
  > * An observable output or behavior
  > * A controlled environment such as a single isolated process
  >
  > T. Winters et al. _Software Engineering at Google_

You know already

  * Unit Testing: What is the _unit_ in unit testing?

--

  * Integration Testing
  <img src="https://twilio-cms-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/MyR86UeunZJcErQJmlEoEwWpAt56uIH2k2mHFqfsA95S2R.width-500_NbXJ1BV.png" width="20%">

  > In contrast to unit tests, integration tests:
  >
  > * Use the actual components that the app uses in production.
  > * Require more code and data processing.
  > * Take longer to run.
  >
  > https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/test/integration-tests?view=aspnetcore-6.0

--

  > Integration tests check whether different chunks of code are interacting successfully in a local environment. A “chunk of code” can manifest in many ways, but generally integration tests involve verifying service/API interactions. Since integration tests are generally local, you may need to mock different services.

### UI Tests with Selenium

  > The story starts in 2004 at ThoughtWorks in Chicago, with Jason Huggins building the Core mode as "JavaScriptTestRunner" for the testing of an internal Time and Expenses application (Python, Plone). Automatic testing of any applications is core to ThoughtWork's style, given the Agile leanings of this consultancy. He has help from Paul Gross and Jie Tina Wang. For them, this was a day job.
  >
  > Jason started demoing the test tool to various colleagues. Many were excited about its immediate and intuitive visual feedback, as well as its potential to grow as a reusable testing framework for other web applications.

## Practices for Software Quality: Pair programming

  > By  working  in tandem,  the  pairs  completed their  assignments 40% to 50% faster.
  >
  > [L. Williams et al. _"Strengthening the Case for Pair Programming"_](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=854064)



  > The top benefit was fewer bugs in the source code. One person
said "it greatly reduces bug numbers." Simple bugs were found
and fixed, as one respondent reported, "there are fewer 'petty'
bugs." In addition, respondents speculated that the longer bugs
live in the code, the more difficult they are to fix. Using pair pro-
gramming, "bugs are spotted earlier" in the development process,
and "may prevent bugs before [they are] deeply embedded."
  >
  > A. Begel et al. [_"Pair programming: what's in it for me?"_](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew-Begel/publication/221494979_Pair_Programming_What%27s_in_it_for_Me/links/0c960522018d66773d000000/Pair-Programming-Whats-in-it-for-Me.pdf)

  > for a development-time cost of about 15%, pair programming improves design quality, reduces defects, reduces staffing risk, enhances technical skills, improves team communications and is considered more enjoyable at statistically significant levels.

## Practices for Software Quality: Code reviews

  > At a cost of 1-2% of the project, a 40% decrease in the number of issues  was  found.
  >
  > R.A. Baker Jr [_"Code reviews enhance software quality"_](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/253228.253461)

  > Findings  show  that  unreviewed  commits  (i.e., commits  that did  not  undergo  a  review  process)  have  over  two  times  more chances of introducing bugs than reviewed commits (i.e., commits that  underwent  a  review  process).  In  addition,  code  committed after  review  has  a  substantially  higher  readability  with  respect to  unreviewed  code.
  >
  > G. Bavota et al. [_"Four eyes are better than two: On the impact of code reviews on software quality"_](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.709.2980&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

  > we ﬁnd that both code review coverage and participation share a significant link with software quality. Low code review coverage and participation are estimated to produce components with up to two and five additional post-release defects respectively. Our results empirically confirm the intuition that poorly reviewed code has a negative impact on software quality [...]

## Practices for Software Quality: Static Analysis


In the following we want to asses some qualities of an earlier version of *ITU-MiniTwit*, the one published in the master branch of https://github.com/itu-devops/itu-minitwit-monitoring.

Since that program is a Python program, I will show you in the following some tools from the Python realm but similar ones exist for any of your languages.
The following tool presentation is inspired by https://luminousmen.com/post/python-static-analysis-tools

### How to measure maintainability and TD?

The answer is likely similar to as to how to measure software quality: It is neither easy nor straight forward.

Even though difficult and not straight forward, there exists a number tools that automatically measure various quality attributes of software (currently mainly source code):

For example, the following tools allow to asses software code quality:

### How to measure maintainability and TD?

  * [Sonarqube](https://sonarcloud.io)
    - Provides a maintainability and TD measure/index
    - Example:  https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=itu-devops_itu-minitwit-terraform
  * [Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/)
    - Provides a maintainability index
  * ~~[Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com/)~~
    - Focuses on maintainability, mainly based on the book:
      - J. Visser et al. [_"Building Maintainable Software, Java Edition"_](
https://books.google.dk/books?id=2MV4CwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=building+maintainable+software+java&hl=da&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwith7qMx7DvAhUF7KQKHbOZBvYQ6AEwAHoECAIQAg#v=onepage&q=building%20maintainable%20software%20java&f=false)
      - J. Visser et al. [_"Building Maintainable Software, C# Edition"_](https://books.google.dk/books?hl=da&lr=&id=-QVQDAAAQBAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PR2&dq=building+maintainable+software&ots=77PM9UQrHO&sig=wDj8VeCd8dap2Rzc103jykR_K9k&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=building%20maintainable%20software&f=false)

But be aware of what tools actually measure and be aware of:

  > The project or organization must start by making a list of nonfunctional requirements that define the "right code." We call this the quality model.
  >
  > Letouzey et al. 2012 _"Managing Technical Debt with the SQALE Method"_

### Technical Debt for SonarQube - The SQALE method

  > **Technical Debt** (`sqale_index`)
  >
  > Effort to fix all Code Smells. The measure is stored in minutes in the database. An 8-hour day is assumed when values are shown in days.
  >
  > https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/metric-definitions/#header-4

  > **Technical Debt Ratio** (`sqale_debt_ratio`)
  >
  > Ratio between the cost to develop the software and the cost to fix it. The Technical Debt Ratio formula is:
  >
  > `Remediation cost / Development cost`
  >
  > Which can be restated as:
  >
  > `Remediation cost / (Cost to develop 1 line of code * Number of lines of code)`
  >
  > The value of the cost to develop a line of code is 0.06 days.
  >

### Want to write your thesis about SW-Quality, Metrics, Technical Debt, or related topics?

In case you think any of these questions are intriguing and if you think that some of the presented tools appear like black magic and you don't believe/trust them, then all this stuff is my area of research and I love to supervise thesis in this area!

Just feel free to contact me.

### Time to say good-bye

![](http://cdn.lowgif.com/medium/84746cb797486e97-.gif)

... for now. 😢

I won't be gone, I will be in the chat, when required I will join the exercise sessions, and you will see me for sure again in the very last session, when we shut down the simulator and tell you what to do before the exams.

From next week, Mircea will take over and tell you more about interesting topics.

## What to do now?

  * To prepare for your project work, practice with the [exercises](./README_EXERCISE.md)
  * Do the [project work](./README_TASKS.md) until the end of the week
  * And [prepare for the next session](../session_08/README_PREP.md)
