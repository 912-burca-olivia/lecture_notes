#### Analyze software quality and technical debt with SonarQube

Analyze software quality and technical debt of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ application with [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/) ([SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) is a readily available hosted version of SonarQube). Do the following once per group:

  * Navigate to https://sonarcloud.io/
  * Login via Github
  * Add a new project by clicking the `+` sign on the top right of the window followed by `Analyze new project`
  * And select the repository or the repositories that you want to assess.

After the analysis is complete, try to understand with the [documentation](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/user-guide/metric-definitions/#header-4) and if necessary with [Letouzey _"The SQALE method for evaluating technical debt"_](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean_Louis_Letouzey/publication/239763591_The_SQALE_method_for_evaluating_Technical_Debt/links/0c9605357748774a21000000/The-SQALE-method-for-evaluating-Technical-Debt.pdf) what is presented as technical debt. Does that correspond to your understanding of technical debt?
