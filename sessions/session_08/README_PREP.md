## From Monitoring to Logging

Can you answer the following two questions about the performance of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ with your group? 

  * Which of your API endpoints is the slowest? How slow is it? 
  * Where is the time being spent in this endpoint?

How do you find out this info?

Please provide your answers in the [Endpoint Performance Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HpGn7KnHeq2-Ivebk8ghQ942gi7wh2-0iXJouPzIvNY/edit)

Note: As Helge mentioned in class, the project is not about competiting who has a faster implementation. However, in the real world you usually want to know performance information because it's very likely that you will look for optimization candidates among your slowest endpoints.



## Service Level Agreements


Read the following two service license agreements (SLAs): 

- https://cloud.google.com/translate/sla

- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/machine-learning-service/v1_0/)

What can you learn from them if you were to write an SLA for your own API? 
Is there any metric in the two SLAs above that would be relevant for your own API SLA? 


## Stand Up Meetings

As hinted last time, we would like to 

  1. facilitate cross-group knowledge sharing and help and 
  
  2. get a better feeling for where you are in your projects (currently, we have really limited knowledge about it due to the online only setup).

Therefore, we will start the exercise sessions from now on with a set of activities that should allow for that. On Monday, March 22nd, we will start the exercise sessions at 10:10 with a "stand-up" meeting separated by BSc and MSc students.

That is, we will start with opening two breakout rooms, one for BSc and another one for MSc students. You just join the respective breakout room. In the BSc room Helge and two TAs will be present and in the MSc room Mircea and one TA will be present.

Importantly, **please turn on your camera** when joining the room. We would like to know who you actually are. So far you know us, but we do not know you, which is not really fair, is it? Additionally, if we were to meet at university, we would see each other's faces too. (In case you are concerned about somebody seeing your flat, flat mates, etc. just configure a background in your Zoom client.)

From each team, at least one team member provides some short and concise information on each of the three following points:

  1. What was the biggest task the group solved during the last week?
  2. What is the biggest road block that the group has to sort out as soon as possible to proceed with work?
  3. With the other groups, we would like to share the following: ...

For point 1, it does not matter if the solved task was something with relation to a task that we (the teachers) formulated as a task earlier. If it is, there is no problem in that.

The _road block_ in point 2 can be anything, i.e., it might be sorting out how to setup technology XY, how to work with each other in a more joyful manner, how to communicate with each other more effectively in the online only setup, etc.  

Concerning point 3, you can share whatever you like. Something that you learned and that you think others should know about too, some technology, technique, resource, link, etc.

Each team has up to **three** minutes (this is an upper bound and we will interupt if it take longer :)) 


The idea is, that this stand-up meeting should **not** feel like a status meeting for you. Instead, it should form a basis for later discussions with TAs, across groups, with the teachers, during the remainder of the exercise session. As said above, our intention is to facilitate knowledge sharing and 'feeling the pulse' of your projects. Our intention **is not** to judge anybodies work, provide pressure, create stress. That is we would like to talk with each other in a bit more structured manner. If it helps, we can all drink coffee/tea during this meeting :)
