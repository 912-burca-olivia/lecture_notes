## From Monitoring to Logging

Can you answer the following two questions about the performance of your _ITU-MiniTwit_ with your group? 

  * Which of your API endpoints is the slowest? How slow is it? 
  * Where is the time being spent in this endpoint?

How do you find out this info?

Please provide your answers in the [Endpoint Performance Quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HpGn7KnHeq2-Ivebk8ghQ942gi7wh2-0iXJouPzIvNY/edit)

Note: As Helge mentioned in class, the project is not about competiting who has a faster implementation. However, in the real world you usually want to know performance information because it's very likely that you will look for optimization candidates among your slowest endpoints.



## Service Level Agreements


Read the following two service license agreements (SLAs): 

- https://cloud.google.com/translate/sla

- https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/machine-learning-service/v1_0/)

What can you learn from them if you were to write an SLA for your own API? 
Is there any metric in the two SLAs above that would be relevant for your own API SLA?
