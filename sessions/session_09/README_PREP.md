## Revisit Your Docker Notes

We'll be talking about orchestration of Docker containers. 

Thus make sure that you revisit your notes about containerization with Docker. Images, containers, docker-compose; it would be good that these topics and concepts are familiar to you. 

The slides of the Scalability lecture are also online, so feel free to have a look and read up on references upfront if you want to.
