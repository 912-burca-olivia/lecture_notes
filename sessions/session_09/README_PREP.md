## Weekly Sharing


On Monday, March 28th, we will start the exercise sessions at 12:15 with a "stand-up" meeting.

From each team, at least one team member provides concise information that answers of the three following questions:

  1. What was the biggest task the group solved during the last week?
  2. What is the biggest road block that the group has to sort out as soon as possible to proceed with work?
  3. We would like to share the following with the other groups: ...

For question 1, it does not matter if the solved task was something with relation to a task that we (the teachers) formulated as a task earlier. If it is, there is no problem in that.

The _road block_ in question 2 can be anything, i.e., it might be sorting out how to setup technology XY, how to work with each other in a more joyful manner, how to communicate with each other more effectively in the online only setup, etc.  

Concerning question 3, you can share whatever you like. Something that you learned and that you think others should know about too, some technology, technique, resource, link, etc.


The goal of this activity is twofold: 

1. better facilitate cross-group knowledge sharing and help and 
  
2. get a better feeling for where you are in your projects (currently, we have really limited knowledge about it due to no TA and many groups).

The idea is, that this stand-up meeting should **not** feel like a status meeting for you. Instead, it should form a basis for later discussions with TAs, across groups, with the teachers, during the remainder of the exercise session. As said above, our intention is to facilitate knowledge sharing and 'feeling the pulse' of your projects. Our intention **is not** to judge anybodies work, provide pressure, create stress. That is we would like to talk with each other in a bit more structured manner. If it helps, we can all drink coffee/tea during this meeting :)


### Practical Details: 


Each team has up to **three** minutes (this is an upper bound and we will interupt if it take longer :)) 

To reduce the duration of the meeting, we will hold two meetings in parallel, one for BSc and another one for MSc students.
