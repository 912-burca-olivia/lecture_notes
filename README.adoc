* Exam submission: Latest *12/5/2021 14:00*
* Exam dates: 8/6/2021 to 11/6/2021

=== TA Supervision

The TAs will be present in the Zoom meeting during the exercise session from 10:00 to 12:00.

During that time, two breakout rooms will be present for supervision with the groups.

Supervision will be conducted in 20 minute time slots.

Up to two supervision sessions can be conducted simultaneously – one in each breakout room.

A group can sign up for a time slot in the link:https://teams.microsoft.com/l/file/3A6E37D7-808F-4012-8941-E9F69366C349?tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb&fileType=xlsx&objectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fituniversity.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDevOpsSoftwareEvolutionandSoftwareMaintenanceS2021%2FShared%20Documents%2FGeneral%2FSupervisionSignup.xlsx&baseUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fituniversity.sharepoint.com%2Fsites%2FDevOpsSoftwareEvolutionandSoftwareMaintenanceS2021&serviceName=teams&threadId=19:2e0525061c7c44c3b4e57d61edba106b@thread.tacv2&groupId=9505ab1e-489e-4444-a47f-0f8883316005[Excel sheet in our Teams channel].

Groups are encouraged to give a brief heads-up of what their issue is in the signup sheet. This will allow the TAs to assign the person who is most suitable for that issue to the group. Furthermore, if many teams sign up for the same issue, then this can be addressed to the whole class instead.

The signup table for the next week will be marked in yellow in the sheet. On Mondays, the signup table for the present day will be marked in green.

=== Recordings

Recorded lectures (screen and voice) should be accessible on
link:https://app.vidgrid.com/content/YsEew5BpMdKm[VidGrid].

=== Recommendation

All examples in class target link:https://linuxmint.com/download.php[Download Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa], which is in essence a link:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/[Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa)].
Since all sessions contain hands-on exercises, we recommend that you have such a Linux version installed on a computer.
(In case you decide to run another operating system, we cannot provide too much support for these during class.) The recommended setup is to have Linux Mint/Ubuntu installed natively on your machine.

Find installation instructions link:https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/sessions/session_00/README.adoc[session_00/README.adoc].


=== Team

* *Teachers*: Helge, Mircea
* *TAs*: Alexander, Michał, and Sebastian


=== Communication

Outside teaching sessions you can communicate with each other, the TAs and the teachers via the link:https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a2e0525061c7c44c3b4e57d61edba106b%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=9505ab1e-489e-4444-a47f-0f8883316005&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb[Teams channel].
