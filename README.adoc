=== Recordings

Recorded lectures (screen and voice) should be accessible on
link:https://app.vidgrid.com/content/YsEew5BpMdKm[VidGrid].

=== Recommendation

All examples in class target link:https://linuxmint.com/download.php[Download Linux Mint 20.1 Ulyssa], which is in essence a link:http://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/[Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS (Focal Fossa)].
Since all sessions contain hands-on exercises, we recommend that you have such a Linux version installed on a computer.
(In case you decide to run another operating system, we cannot provide too much support for these during class.) The recommended setup is to have Linux Mint/Ubuntu installed natively on your machine.

Find installation instructions link:sessions/session_00/README.adoc.


=== Team

* *Teachers*: Helge, Mircea
* *TAs*: Alexander, Michał, and Sebastian


=== Communication

Outside teaching sessions you can communicate with each other, the TAs and the teachers via the link:<TBA>[Teams channel].


=== Groups

To be formed during the first session.
