=== TA Supervision

Currently, we do not have any TAs for this course.
Mircea and Helge will provide some supervision during the exercise sessoins.
In case you know of some "older" students that are experienced in the courses topic and that might be interested in TAing, please let us know.

=== Recordings

This is not a distance course.
This term, we will not record the lectures.
You will have access to all written lecture material through this repository though.


=== Recommendation

All examples in class target link:https://pop.system76.com/[Pop!_OS 21.10].
Essentially, this is a link:http://releases.ubuntu.com/21.10/[Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri)] Linux distribution.
There are many more such Ubuntu derivates, choose one of your liking: link:https://linuxmint.com/[Linux Mint], link:https://elementary.io/[Elementary OS], link:https://neon.kde.org/[KDE Neon], etc.

Since all sessions contain hands-on exercises, we recommend that you have such a Linux version installed on a computer.
(In case you decide to run another operating system, we cannot provide too much support for these during class.) The recommended setup is to have such a Linux installed natively on your machine.

Find installation instructions link:https://github.com/itu-devops/lecture_notes/blob/master/sessions/session_00/README.adoc[session_00/README.adoc].

Note, we do not have any experiences with the new M1-based Macs.
Neither do we have access to one of these.
Consequently, likely many of the technologies that we demonstrate will have issues on these computers and we won't be able to support you much.

=== Team

* *Teachers*: Helge, Mircea

=== Communication

Outside teaching sessions you can communicate with each other, and with the teachers via the link:https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3at2eMODhCLxCUfaecj1m3xtnOsq787tnYXq02rV8qwws1%40thread.tacv2/General?groupId=2c09f960-9e5a-4ca9-a10b-5297d2b6a724&tenantId=bea229b6-7a08-4086-b44c-71f57f716bdb[the course's Teams channel].
